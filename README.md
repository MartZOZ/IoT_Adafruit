# IoT_Adafruit
This is a project for school.
Connect an adafruit dashboard to control an LED on your arduino board.



Step-by-step

Connect your arduino board with an LED

Upload Pyfirmata

Download my python script 

Change the adafruit key to your own (the one in the script is old)

Create one or two blocks, one toggle, and another can be a value

rename the toggle block feed to "digital", and rename a value block to "counter"

Run the python script

if you've done everything correctly you should be able to control an LED with the toggle button on your dashboard :)
